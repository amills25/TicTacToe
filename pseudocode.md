#### Deconstruct and Identify
##### NOTES from 09/30 whiteboard
Things to think about
1. Dynamically build UI
2. Understand what State is
```
class TicTacToe {
let ttt = new TicTacToe();
    constructor
}
```
3. Look at it visually
 * an array or a grid? what is it?
 * what's it going to look like when different things happen
 * what does a tile look like? what kind of data does it hold?
 * different states for each tile for blank, X, or O
4. Roles and Responsibilities
 * who does what in the game?
 * what are the events?
 * what are the win-conditions?


#### Functionality
I want to be able to have 2 users interacting in a game of tic-tac-toe, selecting O or X in the given square of the grid, and IF if there was a winner and how it was achieved.

#### Objects and Data Structures
* player1
* player2
* class TicTacToe{}
* ttt


### START
what happens in between?
* INIT()
### END

#### Functions and such
* init()
* drawX()
* drawO()
* show()
* hide()
* win()
