##### NOTES from 09/30 whiteboard
Things to think about
1. Dynamically build UI
2. Understand what State is
```
Class TicTacToe
let ttt = new TicTacToe();
    constructor
}
```
3. Look at it visually
 * an array or a grid? what is it?
 * what's it going to look like when different things happen
 * what does a tile look like? what kind of data does it hold?
 * different states for each tile for blank, X, or O
4. Roles and Responsibilities
 * who does what in the game?
 * what are the events?
 * what are the win-conditions?
